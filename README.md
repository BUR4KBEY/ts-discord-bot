    constructor(client: DiscordClient) {
        super(client, {
            name: 'example',
            group: 'Developer',
            description: 'An example command.',
            require: {
                developer: true
            }
        });
    }

    async run(message: Message, args: string[]) {
        await message.reply('Wow, example command working!');
    }

    constructor(client: DiscordClient) {
        super(client, 'guildMemberAdd');
